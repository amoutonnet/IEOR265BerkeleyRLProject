# On the use of reinforcement learning to play multiple Atari games

## Planned work

- First, we will use the Open AI Gym library from python to get the environments working. Implementing a program capable of playing (randomly) the games will be our first step.
- Second, we will set up some useful functions to do reinforcement learning: building a storage function to collect the data of observations, taken actions, earned rewards...
- Third, we will start by implementing a very easy Q-Learning algorithm to find the optimal policy to play each game, and see what performances we can reach on them.
- Fourth, we will complexify the architecture of the agent with methods such as asynchronous actor critic agents to reach even better performances.
- Finally, if we have enough time, we will try to build a general artificial intelligence , capable of playing not only one game, but the three of them (breakout, space invaders and pacman).
